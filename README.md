## About The Project

Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

In this implementation of the game, player is given three options; rock, paper and scissors. Once player chooses an option, Computer makes its choice as well. Depending on the choice of both; player and computer, a winner is selected.
